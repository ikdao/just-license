Indie Minimal FOSS/FSF compliant(not yet approved) drop in license

**Just License** is a minimal, permissive, and Free Software Foundation (FSF)-compliant open source license designed to be simple, clear, and developer-friendly—without compromising user freedoms.

## 📜 About

The **Just License** is a free software license that meets all the requirements of the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) for inclusion in the [FSF's list of Free Software Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html). It grants users the essential freedoms defined by the FSF:

- Freedom to run the program for any purpose.
- Freedom to study how the program works and modify it.
- Freedom to redistribute copies.
- Freedom to distribute modified versions.

Unlike more verbose licenses, **Just License** strips away legalese and boilerplate while preserving legal enforceability and user rights.

## ✅ Features

- **FSF-compliant**: Fully respects the Four Freedoms of Free Software, not approved yet.
- **Permissive**: Allows use in proprietary projects (with proper attribution).
- **Minimal**: Only a few lines long—easy to read, understand, and apply.
- **No warranty**: Provided “as is,” with no liability to the authors.
- **Compatible**: Designed to be compatible with other major free software licenses.

## 📄 License Text

```
Copyright (c) [year] [copyright holder]
Just License

[Project] - [Published on] - [Person/People]

No limitations/conditions
No liabilities/confinements
```

> ℹ️ Replace `[year]` and `[copyright holder]` with your details when applying the license.

## 🧩 Usage

To apply the **Just License** to your project:

1. Copy the license text above into a file named `LICENSE` (or `LICENSE.txt`) in your project root.
2. Replace `[year]` with the current year (e.g., `2025`) and `[copyright holder]` with your name or organization.
3. Add a short notice in your source files (optional but recommended):

   ```text
   SPDX-License-Identifier: Just
   ```

   or

   ```text
   Licensed under the Just License. See LICENSE for details.
   ```

## 🔍 Why “Just”?

- **Just** as in *fair* — it treats users and developers equitably.
- **Just** as in *only* — it includes only what’s necessary.
- **Just** as in *righteous* — it upholds software freedom without compromise.

## 🤝 Compatibility & Recommendations

- The **Just License** is similar in spirit and terms to the MIT and BSD licenses.
- It is suitable for libraries, applications, and tools where permissive licensing is desired.
- If you require copyleft (i.e., derivative works must also be free), consider the GNU GPL instead.
